<p>Kumbh Sans is a Geometric Sans Serif font envisioned to serve as a multi-purpose and workhorse font in modern web and mobile applications. The anatomy is geometric with slight contrast. The font's cap-height vs x-height ratio is kept as 3:2 for optimum legibility at any point size.</p>

<p>After initial release in three weights, the font has now been converted into a Variable font. Now it supports weight axis (100 to 900) and optical axis (8 to 72). The optical axis was added to provide more contrast and readability at different point sizes, making it slightly Humanist.</p>
