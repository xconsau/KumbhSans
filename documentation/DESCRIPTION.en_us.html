<p>Kumbh Sans is a Geometric Sans Serif font envisioned to serve as a multi-purpose and workhorse font in modern web and mobile applications. The anatomy is geometric with slight contrast. The font's cap-height vs x-height ratio is kept as 3:2 for optimum legibility at any point size.</p>

<p>After initial release in three weights, the font has now been converted into a Variable font. Now it supports weight axis (100 to 900) and Contrast(Geometric) axis (0% to 100%). The custom contrast axis was added to improve legibility and personality at different point sizes. The font can be seen as more Humanist at higher range of the contrast axis.</p>
