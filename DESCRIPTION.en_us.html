<p>Kumbh Sans is a Geometric Sans Serif font envisioned to serve as a multi-purpose font in modern web and mobile applications. The anatomy is geometric with slight contrast. The font's cap-height vs x-height ratio is kept as 3:2 for optimum legibility at any point size.</p>

<p>Currently the font is available in two variants &mdash; Regular and Bold. I plan to create more variants with the help of contributors if the font gets good response.</p>
